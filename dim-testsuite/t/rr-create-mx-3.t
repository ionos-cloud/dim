# RFC7505
# " ... To indicate that a domain does not accept email, it advertises a single
# MX RR (see Section 3.3.9 of [RFC1035]) with an RDATA section consisting of
# preference number 0 and a zero-length label, written in master files as ".",
# as the exchange domain, to denote that there exists no mail exchanger for a
# domain. ... "

# A NULL MX record is handled like a CNAME. There can only be one.
