2017-01-06  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * Released version 0.13

        * ZoneVerifier: detect duplicate RRSIGs as well as other duplicate
        RRs.
        * DnsSecVerifier: check that the RRset's TTL <= OrigTTL.

2016-12-09  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * Add key generation, signing, verification support for elliptic
        curve algorithms: ECDSA P-256 (13) and ECDSA P-384 (15).
        - Opportunistically load the bouncycastle provider for ECCGOST
        support.
        * DnsKeyAlgorithms: refactoring, new methods to better support
        elliptic curve, alias, knowing what algorithms are supported.
        * KeyGen: do not display unsupported algorithms.

2016-08-22  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * Update internal dnsjava to 2.1.7-vrsn-1.

2014-04-22  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * ZoneFormat: Make -N also compute original ownernames for empty
        non-terminal NSEC3 records.

        * ZoneVerifier: Improve the zone verifiers handling of "junk" in a
        zone (i.e., ignore resource records that aren't actually in the
        zone itself.)

2012-07-16  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * Released version 0.12.

        * TypeMap: fix the fromBytes() method, which was incorrect and add
        a static fromString() method.
        * ProtoNSEC3: use TypeMap's toString method, rather than fetching
        the array of types and rendering them directly.

2012-05-29  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * Released version 0.11.

2012-05-26  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * Update dnsjava to dnsjava-2.1.3-vrsn-1.  Update the code to
        adjust for API changes in dnsjava-2.1.x.  Highlights:
        - no longer use DNSSEC.Failed, DNSSEC.Secure as those constants
        are now gone.  Instead, any methods returning those constants now
        return a boolean, true for DNSSEC.Secure, false for DNSSEC.Failed
        or DNSSEC.Insecure.
        - No longer use KEYConverter.  Instead, uses the new DNSKEYRecord
        constructor.
        - The NSEC3 digest type is now an int (rather than a byte)
        - Algorithm references are now DNSSEC.Algorithm.<alg>

        * jdnssec-verifyzone: Add duplicate RR detection (on by default)
        and a command line option to disable it.

2011-02-14  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * Released version 0.10.1.

2011-02-12  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * Use Java 1.5 generic types when possible.  DNSJava itself still
        doesn't use them, so we have to suppress warnings when we use
        RRset.rrs(), etc.
        * Update commons-cli to version 1.2.
        * Refactor all of the command line classes.  A new command line
        base class has been created to eliminate much of the duplicated
        code.

2011-02-09  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * Enable reading and writing from stdin/stdout for most tools.  To
        do this, use '-' as the zonefile name.
        * jdnssec-signzone, jdnssec-signrrset: remove 'multiline' output
        as the default and add a command line switch (-m) to enable it.
        That is, these tools will output each RR on a single line by
        default, adding -m will restore the prior behavior.

2011-02-08  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * Minor cleanups to usage statement printing across most of the tools.

2011-02-03  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * Released version 0.10
        * jdnssec-keygen: update the default algorithm to 8 (instead of 5).
        * Update logging across all command line tools to use a consistent
        '-v' option, and consistent, simpler log formatting.
        * jdnssec-verifyzone: resume logging the key information at INFO,
        but make the default log level WARNING.  To see the old logging
        behavior, use -v 4.

2011-02-02  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * DnsKeyConverter: support the new BIND 9.7 private key format,
        which only entails recognizing the new version string, since the
        new format is a superset of the old format.

2011-01-11  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * jdnssec-zoneformat: add a -m option for formatting as
        multiline.  Add a -N option for determining the original
        ownernames for NSEC3 signed zones.

2010-12-14  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * jdnssec-verifyzone: Add options to either fudge or ignore RRSIG
        inception and expiration times.

2010-12-06  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * jdnssec-verifyzone: Complete refactored the verification code to
        more comprehensively check a zone for DNSSEC validity.  Instead of
        just verifying signatures, it will also check to see if the NSEC
        or NSEC3 chains are valid.

2010-12-05  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * jdnssec-signzone: Fix a bug that would incorrectly handle
        delgations below delegations (those should be ignored.)

        * jdnssec-signzone: Make the signer ignore junk below a DNAME.
        This differs from BIND's dnssec-signzone behavior (currently), but
        is the correct behavior, as stuff below a DNAME doesn't actually
        exist in DNS.  Note that if a name in a zone has both a DNAME and
        a NS RRset (and is not at the apex), then the behavior is a bit
        undefined.

        * jdnssec-signzone: Fix a bug that would incorrectly set the RRSIG
        bit for NSEC3 RRs corresponding to insecure delegations.

        * jdnssec-signzone: add a "verbose signing" option.  This will
        cause the pre-signed bytes and the raw signature bytes to be
        output when signing.
        * Other fixes: some minor tweaks and comment fixes.
        Unfortunately, also a lot of rewrapping and whitespace changes due
        to Eclipse.  Sigh.

2010-01-14  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * Released version 0.9.6

2010-01-09  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * Upgrade to DNSJava 2.0.8 (plus a few local changes).  2.0.8
        fixes a major bug in typemap wire conversion.

2009-11-02  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * Released version 0.9.5

2009-11-01  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * Upgrade to DNSJava 2.0.7 (plus a few local changes).
        * DnsKeyAlogorithm: change the RSASHA512 number to 10.

2009-08-23  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * Released version 0.9.4

2009-07-15  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * SignUtils: Fix major issue where the code that generates that
        canonical RRset given signature data wasn't obeying the "Orig TTL"
        and "Labels" fields.  This is a major issue with verification,
        although it doesn't affect signature generation.

        * VerifyZone:  Fix bug where the whole-zone security status was
        still wrong: unsigned RRsets shouldn't make the zone Bogus.

2009-06-12  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * VerifyZone: Fix bug in verification logic so that RRsets that
        never find a valid signature (i.e., only have signatures by keys
        that aren't in the zone) are considered Bogus.  Note that
        VerifyZone still can't tell if a RRset that should be signed
        wasn't (or vice versa).

        * dnsjava: Update local copy of dnsjava library.  This version
        adds NSEC3 agorithms to DNSSECVerifier and KEYConverter, emulates
        DiG's "OPT PSEUDOSECTION" formatting in Message.toString(), and
        adds a minimal DHCIDRecord type.  Note that the DNSjava trunk has
        a different (although functional similar) version of this type.

2009-06-09  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * VerifyZone: Improve the output.

        * SignKeyset: Add a command line tool for just signing DNSKEY RRsets.

2009-02-10  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * Released version 0.9.0

2009-02-08  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * KeyGen: make RSA large exponent the default.  Make it possible
        to select small exponent.

        * KeyInfoTool: add more info to the output, handle multiple files
        on the command line.

        * DnsKeyAlgorithm: use DNSjava constants, BIND 9.6 mnemonics for
        NSEC3 key aliases.

2009-02-07  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * SignZone: add argument for setting the TTL of the NSEC3PARAM
        record.  This is so we can match current dnssec-signzone
        (9.6.0-p1) behavior of using a TTL of zero.

        * Update dnsjava to 2.0.6-vrsn-2, commons-cli to 1.1

        * SignUtils: fix bug where NSEC3 algorithm and flags were transposed.

        * SignUtils: Make sure to use the SOA minimum value for NSEC TTLs,
        instead of the ttl of the "node".

2009-02-04  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * update to dnsjava-2.0.1-vrsn-4 (updated typecodes for
        NSEC3/NSEC3PARAM).

        * SignUtils: use JDK-native SHA-256 code instead of broken
        contributed implementation.

        * DnsKeyAlgorithm: Add RSASHA256 and RSASHA512 algorithm, guessing
        at the code points.  Note, these require Java 5 or later, or an
        alternate crypto provider.

        * ZoneUtils: add a method to find specific RRs in a list of RRs
        or RRsets.

        * SignZone: make jdnssec-signzone a bit more aggressive in finding
        keys. Now it will look for keyfiles matching keys at the zone
        apex, and, failing that, just look for keyfiles named after the
        zone.  Specifying any keys at all on the command line will
        override this behavior.

2009-02-01  David Blacka  <davidb@verisign.com>

        * DnsKeyAlgorithm: add official aliases from RFC 5155.

        * JCEDnsSecSigner: refactor zone signing methods to remove
        duplicate code.

        * SignZone: move the signZone() methods to JCEDnsSecSigner

        * BINDKeyUtils: close the private key file after reading it.
        Patch by Wolfgang Nagele.

2006-12-15  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

        * Release version 0.8.4

        * SignZone: updated internals (and dnsjava lib) to match wire
        format changes introduced by the nsec3-08 draft.

2006-10-10  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

        * Released version 0.8.3

        * ZoneFormat: fix RRSIG ordering issue when dealing with multiple
        RRSIGs for a given RRset.

        * ZoneFormat: lowercase all names in the zone.

        * Fix packaging errors.


2006-09-12  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

        * Released version 0.8.0.

2006-09-10  David Blacka  <davidb@fury.blacka.com>

        * Added the "KeyInfoTool" command line tool as the start of a tool
        for decoding DNSKEY information.  Right now, mostly just useful
        for checking the public exponenent of RSA keys.

        * Added the "-e" option to jdnssec-keygen, to instruct the key
        generator to use the (common) large exponent in RSA key
        generation.

2006-08-31  David Blacka  <davidb@fury.blacka.com>

        * Modified jdnssec-signzone to set the ttls of NSEC3 records (so
        far) to the SOA minimum value.

        * Add NSEC3PARAM support for compatibility with the -07 NSEC3
        draft.

2006-05-24  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

        * Add some error checking for the NSEC3 command line parameters
        for jdnssec-signzone.

        * Update local dnsjava build to 2.0.1.  This also contains a
        change to the NSEC3 rdata format (as per the -06pre NSEC3 draft).
        The change is the addition of a "next hashed owner name" length
        octet.

        * Modified the jdnssec-* shell wrappers to also use the local
        build area version of the jdnssec-tools.jar file.  This allows the
        standard jdnssec-* wrappers to work right from the build area.

        * Add support of the SHA256 algorithm for DS records.  This uses
        the SHA256 class that I obtained from Scott Rose (thanks Scott!).

        * Change the name of the package and jar file to jdnssec-tools
        (from java-dnssec-tools) for consistency.

        * release version 0.7.0.

2006-05-23  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

        * Add support for algorithm aliases.  This feature is so that the
        user can declare the DNSKEY algorithm x is the same as algorithm 5
        (e.g.).  So far, this only works with straight integer algorithm
        identifiers (no private alg support yet).

        * Fix jdnssec-signzone so that you can specify multiple KSKs on
        the command line.  Apparently, commons-cli actually does handle
        repeating command line options correctly.

2006-05-03  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

        * Add preliminary implementation of jdnssec-dstool.  This is a
        simple command line tool that takes a DNSKEY record and converts
        it into a DS record (or a DLV record).  Right now, it requires
        that the key is stored in a file ending with '.key'.

        * release version 0.6.0.

2006-03-15  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

        * Type map changes for NSEC3, corresponding to changes in draft
        -05pre.  Essentially: NSEC3 and RRSIG bits are not set for most
        (all) NSEC3 records any longer.

2006-03-06  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

        * release version 0.5.0.

2006-02-16  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

        * Make RecordComparator also compare RDATA so the removeDuplicates
        step actually works reliabled.  This was masked by the dupicate
        suppression in org.xbill.DNS.RRset.

        * Only allow one command line specified KSK since commons-cli
        doesn't seem to handle multi-arg options correctly.

        * Do not croak on the lack of the command-line keys for now.

        * New version of local dnsjava build containing NSEC3 changes
        corresponding to the -04pre draft.

2005-11-16  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

        * Make jdnssec-verifyzone work with just the zone (which is
        self-signed anyway).

        * release version 0.4.2.

2005-11-09  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

        * Add original ownername comments to the NSEC3 generation.

2005-11-08  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

        * New zone formatter.

        * Misc bug fixes.

        * release version 0.4.1.

2005-11-07  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

        * Update the local dnsjava build with a bugfix.

        * Fix ordering problem with ProtoNSEC3s.

2005-11-06  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

        * Actually use the --iterations command line option of
        jdnssec-signzone.

2005-10-27  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

        * Add NSEC3 support for jdnssec-signzone.

        * Remove support for plain Opt-In (until private algorithms work).

        * release version 0.4.0.

2005-08-14  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

        * Move the signZone function into the SignZone class (from the
        SignUtils) class.

        * General cleanup.

        * Add local _jdnssec-* shell wrappers.  These use build/classes in
        the classpath so can be used to run the tools right out of the
        build area.

2005-08-13  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

        * Update to DNSjava 2.0.0

        * Refactor command line parsing.

        * Switch to using java.util.logging for logging.
