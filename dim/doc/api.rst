.. _api:

API
===

Conventions
-----------

Most of the functions have a last parameter called *options*. If present, it
must be an object with name:value pairs.

Global Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the options documented separately for each function, all
functions also accept the following options:

- *dryrun*: roll back the changes made to the database during this function call


API Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this page are formatted the same way they appear in ``ndcli
--debug`` output. That is, for the JSON-RPC request::

  {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":null,"method":"zone_list","params":[{"pattern": "a*"}]}

the examples will list the call as::

  zone_list({'pattern': 'a*'})


.. _check-options:

Check Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some functions share a common list of options which can be used to specify
additional checks for the CIDR argument they receive:

- *pool*: check if CIDR is inside this pool
- *delegation*: check if CIDR is inside this delegation
- *host*: if true, check if CIDR is a host address (prefix 32 for IPv4 or 128
  for IPv6)
- *status*: check if CIDR is a block with this status


.. _messages:

Messages
~~~~~~~~

Some functions return a list of messages explaining the actions taken by the
server. The messages are usually returned in a field called *messages*. Each
message contains the severity and a string. For example::

  {'messages': [[30, 'Creating zone test.com without profile'],
                [30, 'Primary NS for this Domain is now localhost.']]}

The severity values have the following meaning:

- 10: DEBUG
- 20: INFO
- 25: DNS record
- 30: WARNING
- 40: ERROR

.. _soa_attributes:

SOA Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An object containing values for SOA fields; these values will override the
defaults or the values from *from_profile*.

Example::

       {
           'primary': 'ns.test.com.',
           'mail': 'admin.test.com.',
           'serial': '101',
           'ttl': '3600'
       }


.. _view_option:

View Option
~~~~~~~~~~~

Some functions take a *view* option. As explained in :ref:`dns_concepts`, if the
zone only has one view, this option can be omitted. If the zone has multiple
views, this option is required.


.. _profile_option:

Profile Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If *profile* option is true, the function will operate on zone profiles instead
of zones.

.. _rr_options:

RR Options
~~~~~~~~~~

When creating or specifying a RR, the following options are available:

- *name* (string): the fqdn of the RR or the relative name if *zone* was
  specified; it can be omitted if *type* is PTR and the *ip* is specified
- *type* (string): one of the supported RR types (A, AAAA, PTR, CNAME, MX, NS,
  SRV, TXT, SPF, RP, CERT, HINFO, NAPTR)
- :ref:`layer3domain_option`. The layer3domain value is optional when specifying a RR
  if there is only one RR with that name, type and value.

In addition to *name* and *type*, the right side of a RR (the value) is
specified differently for each type:

- A/AAAA: *ip*
- PTR: *ptrdname*
- CNAME: *cname*
- MX: *preference*, *exchange*
- NS: *nsdname*
- SRV: *priority*, *weight*, *port*, *target*
- TXT/SPF: *strings* (can be either a list of strings or a single string
  containing quoted strings)
- RP: *mbox*, *txtdname*
- CERT: *certificate_type*, *key_tag*, *algorithm*, *certificate*
- HINFO: *cpu*, *os*
- NAPTR: *order*, *preference*, *flags*, *service*, *regexp*, *replacement*

The RR value is optional when specifying a RR if there are no other RRs with
that name and type.


.. _layer3domain_option:

layer3domain Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Specifies the name of the layer3domain the ipblock/ippool lives in. Optional if only one layer3domain exists.


.. _allow_overlap_option:

allow_overlap Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When true, allows creating *cidr* even when *cidr* already exists in another layer3domain.
However, this will only be permitted if *cird* is inside one of the whitelisted subnets that allow overlapping
(configured by DIM admins).
